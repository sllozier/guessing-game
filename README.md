# Foundations.DOM.Pair.Programming.GuessingGame.Solution

## Overview

The app will randomly generate a number from 1-100, and the player will try to guess that number in a limited number of attempts. The app will give feedback depending on how close the user's guess is and will also keep track of previous guesses.

This will be your first complete web app. You will be writing the HTML, CSS, and JS to create a cohesive experience for users.

Here are a few examples from previous students:

- [Example 1](https://jmunoz1992.github.io/Guessing-Game-Final/)
- [Example 2](https://tkbrooks.github.io/guessing-game/)

## Getting Started

1. The Driver should create a repository and add the Navigator as a collaborator.
2. Clone the repository. Both partners should have local copies.
3. Swap the Driver/Navigator roles as you work.
4. Use Git and Github to collaborate. Remember to pull and push.

There are three **tabs** below: Game Logic, Instructions, and Extensions

### Game Logic

Here is how the game operates:

1. A winning number between 1-100 will be randomly generated.
2. The player inputs their guess in a text input field.
3. The player clicks a button to submit their guess.
4. If the player guesses the winning number, they win! Otherwise, they are allowed to try again.
5. The game should give a hint after each guess, letting them know whether to guess higher or lower as well as how close they are.
6. After five unsuccessful guesses, the game is over and the player loses.

### Instructions

At a minimum, your repository should contain three files: `index.html`, `index.js`, and `main.css`.

1. Write the HTML. Make sure that you have included a header, instructions, a text input field, and buttons.
2. Write the JS. Follow the game logic as closely as possible.
3. Write the CSS to make your website look nice.
4. Check for errors and edge cases. Try to break your game.

You are encouraged to look at the examples for reference at any time.

### Extensions

If you got the base functionality working, i.e., the player sees their past guesses, they receive appropriate hints, and they can win/lose, then try to implement these extensions:

- Reset Button: When this button is clicked, the game is reset back to its starting state.
- Hint Button: When this button is clicked, the player is provided three random numbers, one of which is the winning number.
- Style: Make the game your own. Add your own flavor text, images, and style.

**Done?** Make sure you have completed all three tabs above: **Game Logic, Instructions, and Extensions.**
